    <h1>Description </h1>
     <p>Garfield's Lasagna Recipe With Minced Meat And Italian Spices takes more time to be prepared but at the end of the baking when you smell this divine combination of minced meat between herbed lasagna pasta sheets, you will definitely feel that it was totally worth it. I make the mince and the eggplant on a previous day and then do the assembling and baking on the next day if I am short of time.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1> 
     <ul>
        <li>9 Lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>1/2 kg Chicken	, minced or mutton </li>
        <li>2 Whole Eggs</li>
     </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
     <ol>
        <li>To begin crafting this recipe, firstly, preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Cut eggplants into thin circles and dredge with a teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <li>Leave for ten minutes and then squeeze out water, pressing the eggplants between palms. Rub/bast olive oil on the eggplants and put into hot oven for ten minutes or till they change color and appear cooked. Keep aside.</li>
     </ol>
